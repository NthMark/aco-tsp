## Implementing Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for a given Symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP)
Taking as data the **The 100-city problem A** `kroA100.tsp` by *Krolak/Felts/Nelson* (and additional results for **52 locations in Berlin** `berlin52.tsp` by *Groetschel*)

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
It is an **optimization algorithm** used to find the shortest path between points or nodes. It is developed by observing the behaviour of ants when they follow a path to their food source. Ants are essentially blind so they follow pheromone trails left behind by other ants on the path. This algorithm follows the same approach by using the probability of going to the next node as the distance to the node and the amount of pheromones.

### Symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP)
Given a set of **n** nodes and distances for each pair of **nodes**, find a roundtrip of minimal total length visiting each node exactly once. The distance from node *i* to node *j* is the same as from node *j* to node *i*.
